Bellicum acknowledges and agrees that Bellicum’s rights to a refund or credit for, or to receive replacement of, properly rejected shipments of Miltenyi Products hereunder shall be Bellicum’s sole and exclusive remedy, and Miltenyi’s sole obligation, with respect to non-conforming Miltenyi Products delivered hereunder.",
